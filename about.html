        <h2>About TradeTracker</h2>
        <p>TradeTracker is my own personal project as a way to encapsulate my learning of programming.
             TradeTracker has developed and grown with me as I began to learn more and more about coding, 
             originally TradeTracker existed as just an HTML file with no styling, I have since incorporated 
             advanced CSS styling using flex-box, and front end Javascript programming which is used for 
             calculations and Dom manipulation. Future plans for TradeTracker include API incorporation to pull 
             real time data as well as projecting graphs for stock trends, furthermore I am looking to add an 
             account system in which users may have a dashboard to show all pinned stocks and to allow for 
             information to be retained between visits.
