# tradeTracker

Trade Tracker is a personal product on creating a virtual environment to track investments growth and returns.
My goals for trade tracker are to create dynamically generated inforgraphics while also reporting statistics on trades via user input.
Eventually I wish to be able to link most of the information into a back end approach where the necessary information for the program to be run can be obtained autonomusly.
